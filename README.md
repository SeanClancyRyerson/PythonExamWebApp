# PythonExamWebApp
The front end code to a web application designed to be able to create an exam from user generated questions using
constriants and test cases and to be able to take the exam as a student with an autograder setup to grade the user's
answers. Only one of the php files is shown for simplicity sake because they are all a very similar format to one another.
